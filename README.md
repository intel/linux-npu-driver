# Intel® NPU

## Introduction

This repository contains User Mode Driver for Intel® NPU device.

Intel® NPU device is an AI inference accelerator integrated with Intel client CPUs,
starting from Intel® Core™ Ultra generation of CPUs (formerly known as Meteor Lake).
It enables energy-efficient execution of artificial neural network tasks.

To make sure that your system has an NPU available, please follow
[the steps](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000097597/processors.html).

The full device name is Neural Processing Unit, but the Linux kernel driver uses
the older name - Versatile Processing Unit (VPU).

## Driver releases

[The release page contains the binaries and supported component versions](https://github.com/intel/linux-npu-driver/releases).

## Build the driver and common issues

[The docs directory contains overiew.md that explains how to build the driver and common issues](docs/overview.md)
